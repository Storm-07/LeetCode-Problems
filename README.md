# LeetCode-Problems
I'm not really sure what to put in this README file so I'll just write down the day I complete each problem. <br />
(!): means I haven't fully comprehended problem

5/18/22 - KthLargestElement.java <br />
5/22/22 - IslandPerimeter.java <br />
8/7/22 - TwoSum.java <br />
8/8/22 - AddTwoNumbers.java (!)<br />
8/17/22 - LongestSubStringWithoutRepeatingChars.java <br />
8/20/22 - MedianOfTwoArrays.java <br />
12/30/22 - LongestPalindrome.java (!)<br />
1/23/23 - ReverseInteger.java (tried this one for a couple hours only to find a much simpler solution using math :') )<br />
1/26/23 - PalindromeInteger.java <br />
1/27/23 - MostRainwater.java <br />
3/9/23 - romanToInt.py <br />
3/9/23 - LongestCommonPrefix.js <br />
3/10/23 - Three_Sum.java <br />
3/14/23 - LetterCombination.py <br />
3/16/23 - RemoveNode.js <br />
3/17/23 - ValidParenthesis.py <br />
3/19/23 - MergeTwoLists.py <br />
3/20/23 - GenerateParenthesis.js <br />
  - Recursive functions within functions are allowed <br />
  - 'push' method is a javascript method that adds elements to an array(?) <br />
  
7/23/23 - OptimalDivision.py <br />
  - format is arr[0]/(arr[1]/arr[2]/.../arr[N - 1]) <br />
  - .join function joins elements of an iterable by a string separator: '/'.join = x/y/z if arr is [x,y,z] (works for tuples, lists, etc.) <br/ >
  - .format function will take values given as parameters and place them into a string.
    ex: str = "hello my name is {} and I like {}".format(name, concept) if name = storm and concept = coding, it will fill in the blanks. <br />

7/24/23 - BestPokerHand.java <br />
  - be wary of nested for loops when counting <br />

7/25/23 - ThreeLetterSeparation.java <br />
 - Stringbuilder sb = new Stringbuilder(); <br />
 - sb.append(char or str?)
 - sb.setLength(0) clears the stringbuilder <br />
 - You can convert arraylists to arrays easily if it is more convenient to use one (see return line) <br />

7/27/23 - ChunkArray.js <br/ >
 - const and let and var for variables/fields in js. <br />
 - equivalents in js are more akin to triple equals signs at least for numbers. <br />
 - .push function is used to append elements to an array <br />
 - O(n) time complexity for both runtime and memory. One loop is used and variables are used proportionately <br />
